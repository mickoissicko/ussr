You need to edit ussr-ssl.py to represent your scripts' path, and change drive letter.
Remove proxy path if you don't use proxies
This needs some modification to get it running, video tutorial coming soon, so don't worry.
Remember to run ussr-ssl.py and your port-forwarding service in a powershell window. If you are manually port-forwarding, you do not need to worry about this.
