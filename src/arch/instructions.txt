|| This guide will not be user-friendly. If you are smart enough to use Arch, you are smart enough to do this.

|| Let's get Python, flask, and MCRCON installed now!

sudo pacman -Sy python
sudo pacman -S python-virualenv
sudo pacman -S python-pip

|| For flask

cd /src/arch
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/python-flask-git.git
cd python-flask-git
makepkg -si

|| For mcrcon

cd /src/arch/script
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/mcrcon.git
cd mcrcon
makepkg -si

|| BTW, I use Arch
|| If you have trouble running these commands, go RTFM.

|| Let's get the application running 
|| Choose SSL or normal USSR-xxx or USSR-???.py version.

cd /src/arch
sudo python ussr(-ssl).py

|| And that's it!
|| To port-forward, you can use PKTRIOT or NGROK. PKTRIOT is a little complicated to set up.
