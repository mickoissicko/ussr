# PLEASE DELETE THIS FILE IF YOU ENCOUNTER ISSUES RUNNING THE MAIN LAUNCHER SCRIPT
# THE PURPOSE OF THIS FILE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT START.BAT DOESNT RUN MULTIPLE TIMES
#
# WHY? SO YOU CAN LAUNCH USSR-SSL.PY QUICKLY WITHOUT HAVING TO REDOWNLOAD EVERYTHING NUMEROUS TIMES
# WHY DON'T I NEED A LOCK.PA FILE FOR THE LINUX ALTERNATIVE OF THE USSR? BECAUSE LINUX IS A GIGACHAD.
# OR THERE IS A WORKAROUND AND IM JUST... DUMB... I'D PICK THE LATTER ðŸ¤·
