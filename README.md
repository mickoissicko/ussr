# Universal Server Start Remote (USSR)
* USSR is intentional, I wanted to make a funny abbreviation.
* I am not serious, the comments are trash
* Good luck LOL

## Why?
This project started as a funny switch, but I spent over 5 hours making this dumb funny clicky server open-y haha omg switch. Kill me. If you have a Minecraft server, an SMP, and you don't want to use something like Aternos, however, you don't want the prestigous Day count in the server to go up because you left it online for 2 days, well, this is a use for the USSR.
If you are sleeping, your friends can start/stop the server, just remind them to stop it! Really... really, and oddly specific use scenario, but... yeah.
Github is a place for stuff like this, so I think it's pretty cool.
It is NOT user friendly... at all. Good luck installing it. When I get around to making a tutorial, I'll link it here.
